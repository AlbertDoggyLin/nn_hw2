# Machine Learning Model for Self Driving Car

## To run the project

1. create a virtualenv (virtualenv env)
2. install packages (pip install -r requirement.txt)
3. run the main program (python src/main.py)

## Introduction

This project is the homework 2 from **NCU neural network**. Requirement for the homework is using MLP or RBFN as model.
The data set of the homework is the information of car, like distance between different direction, etc.

## Structure
In src/model there are models for MLP and RBFN
