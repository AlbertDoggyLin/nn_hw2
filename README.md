# Machine Learning Model for Self Driving Car

## To run the project

1. clone the project
2. create a virtualenv
3. install packages
4. run the main program

git bash command as follow(if you have install python ofcourse lol):

    git clone https://github.com/AlbertDoggyLin/nn_hw2
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv .
    source Scripts/activate
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    python src/main.py

after first time running

    source Scripts/activate
    python src/main.py


## Introduction

This project is the homework 2 from **NCU neural network**. Requirement for the homework is using MLP or RBFN as model.
The data set of the homework is the information of car, like distance between different direction, etc.

## Structure
In src/model there are models for MLP and RBFN
